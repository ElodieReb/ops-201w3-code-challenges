## ABOUT THIS REPO
This repo serves to store all of the coding practice I conducted while enrolled in Ops 201: Foundations of Computer Operations, a self-paced introductory cybersecurity course by Code Fellows. The coding practice (also referred to as "challenges" throughout this repo) covers concepts such as creating and employing functions and variables in bash and in Powershell, extracting system information, prompting a user for input, and so much more. 

This practice has given me more confidence in writing scripts in both a Linux and Windows environment, and I know the foundation I have built as I have progressed through each challenge will be extremely valuable when the time comes for me to resolve issues and customize systems in an enterprise environment. I am excited by the prospect of gaining more familiarity with bash and batch scripting, specifically in making my scripts more concise and effective in reaching their ultimate goal. There are certainly areas for improvement - as can be seen by the various comments I have scattered throughout my challenges about how I'd like to improve the script if I had more time - however, I am proud of the progress I have made since I began my journey at Code Fellows. More exciting things to come.
